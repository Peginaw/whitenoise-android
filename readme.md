This is an Android app that plays white, pink, and brown noise.

Most white noise apps lack features that I would like to have, so I'm making my own app. Those features are:
* Sleep timer
* Oscillating volume
* Decrescendo-ing volume
* Status bar controls

Additionally most of the existing apps are ugly/outdated, so I'm attempting to use a simple Material design.

This app is still a work in progress. The remaining work is fixing small issues.
